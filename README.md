# Cellular Automaton
Version 2.0 of the Doodlebug homework project from NYU Tandom Bridge program: [hw13](https://github.com/michaelweberjr/TandomBridge/blob/main/mw4732_hw13.cpp)

The base class, Creature, is the base automaton that activates each turn. Specific creature types (Ant, Doodlebug, etc...) derive from the Creature class. This version includes an automated way to register derived classes.

TO-DO: 
* factory system to create derived creatures in a modular way
* add a couple extra creature types for fun
